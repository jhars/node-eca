There could be an issue with the way we are exporting data t /tmp/remoteOutput file.

Since there is ony 1 file being used to hold temporary data, a race condition could arise.

If 1 user quereies data, and another user makes the same query,
 which updates the temp file before the 1st user can read the temp file.

 THis can be resolved by creating timestamped files, specific to each user's query,
  then removing the unique file after the data has been succesfully served.


  >>> It could be also be useful to add timeout and retry functionality to the requests to Filepro,
  this could help resolve the issue if a file is currently being queried by another CS Site User

  We've got an issue with using a global variable for sftp and ssh clients
  we need to reference the same instance of these clients in multiple places on controller (at least i think we do)
  we need to make sure that we disconnet our ssh and sftp sessions,
  should possible be able to to do in the ssh and sftp client helper files

    > currwntly ssh does disconnects on query controller
    > currently sftp disconnects on helper client (getSingleFile)

//JH-NOTE: create new tmp file and query file location w/ better nomenclature

Could add a (thin) NOSql Database that houses data temporarily, made to be overwritten
